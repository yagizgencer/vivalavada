            <p>I once chugged a half-frozen beer, my sixth of the night in a total of 11, because my friends promised to buy the next round if I did. I got my brain half-frozen ever since.</p>

            <p>My favourite beer is Heineken. It's my favorite drink, I can have it every day and even drink 7 or 8 in one day. And yes, I'm proud of it.</p>
